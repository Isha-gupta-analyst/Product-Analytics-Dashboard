 **Product Analytics Dashboard**

## üìå Project Overview
The **Product Analytics Dashboard** is designed to provide actionable insights into product performance, sales trends, and discount effectiveness.  
By visualizing the data in **Power BI** and storing it efficiently using **SQL Server**, this project empowers management teams to make **data-driven decisions**.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of:
- Revenue performance across countries and time periods.
- Year-over-Year (YoY) growth in revenue and profit.
- The impact of discount strategies on overall revenue.
- A detailed table breakdown of revenue and profit at multiple levels.

This project was built to support **strategic decision-making** by tracking key performance metrics and identifying opportunities for growth.

   Compare revenue trends over different years and months.

3. **Profit and Unit Sales YoY Change**  
   High-level summary of growth in profit and units sold.

4. **Revenue Breakdown by Discount Band**  
   Analyze how discounts are impacting total revenue.

5. **Detailed Table View**  
   Breakdown of revenue and profit by country and year.


## üóÇ Dataset Information
The analysis uses three key datasets. These datasets were imported into **SQL Server** for cleaning, transformation, and integration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### **Step 1 ‚Äì Load Data into SQL Server**
1. Create a new database named `ProductAnalytics`.
2.Import CSV files into their respective tables using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
3. Written a SQL query to load the desired data into power BI.

### **Step 2 ‚Äì Connect Power BI to SQL Server**
- Connect Power BI to SQL Server using the database credentials.
- Used a query to load only desired data instead of entire dataset.
- Load the transformed tables into Power BI.

### **Step 4 ‚Äì Build the Dashboard in Power BI**

| Visual Type    | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| **KPI Cards**  | Display key metrics like Total Revenue, Total Profit, Units Sold, YoY Growth % |
| **Bar Chart**  | Revenue by Country |
| **Line Chart** | Monthly Revenue Trend |
| **Donut Chart**| Revenue Breakdown by Discount Band |
| **Matrix Table** | Revenue and Profit by Country and Year |
| **Tooltips** | Provide detailed insights on hover |

### **Step 5 ‚Äì Final Dashboard Layout**
The dashboard consists of **two pages**:
1. **Dashboard** ‚Äì Main page with KPIs and visuals.  
2. **Tooltip Page** ‚Äì Provides detailed drill-through insights.
